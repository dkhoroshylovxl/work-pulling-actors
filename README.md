# Work Pulling Actors

Work pulling with [Akka actors](http://akka.io/). A balanced, workload routing solution.

There's a master that will receive work units and delegates them to its workers. Work is forwarded to workers
only when they are finished with their previous job and request a new one. Until then, work units received in
the master are kept in a collection. That is pluggable, you decide what kind of collection,
it just has to fulfill a small contract, the `WorkBuffer` trait defined. If it's bounded
and excessive work is coming, the master won't accept it but reply with a message saying it is busy.

* To define the work that the workers must do, just implement the function `doWork`.
* Results are sent back wrapped in Try objects, so both Success and Failure are permitted.
* Results are sent back paired with the original work units so that they could be identified and matched if necessary.
* Even though Failures should be properly built and handled, if a worker happens to crash, it will be discarded
and replaced by a new worker, ignoring the problematic work unit.

This solution was based off of Michael Pollmeier's [akka-patterns](https://github.com/mpollmeier/akka-patterns),
but it was changed a lot.
